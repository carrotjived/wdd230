            <p>Netflix is a streaming website that let's user first notice a random playing show that has size bigger
                than
                the rest of the content, then below that big screen are smaller pictures that shows what other videos
                are
                avaialable to be watched, and finally at the last part are smaller than previous pictures that show
                other
                contents available to watch. </p>

            <p>Powermac webpage uses rule of thirds principle by organizing their elements in an imaginary nine by nine
                grid. Their icon on their top left corner, search bar at the top center, and user tools on their top
                right
                corner. A gallery of products consumes the center most row of the grid and the last row is compromised
                by
                the rest of their content for sale. </p>

            <p>Nike used uniform style, color, size to each of their headings and content throughout all the webpage.
                The
                visual images are uniform as well as well as their whitespaces and gaps to each other. </p>
